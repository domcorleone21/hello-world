Trying to learn how to code

I am hoping to learn how to use different programing languages like Ruby, Python, C++, Java
and PHP to make an amazing game and application. Let's see how far I get without giving up!
Somthing tells me I wont give up this time and I am going to write my first screenplay, learn to code
and learn how to play the bass in by 32.
